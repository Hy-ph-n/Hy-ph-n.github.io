<p>I am David Bowen, a college student finishing up his second and final year at TSTC. I major in computer programming, and it's been an exciting experience! During my time here, I've learnt so much and aquired many skills I plan to take with me into a satisfying career.</p>
<p>I plan on graduating Fall 2024, the semester where I'll be taking my final course. It'll be scary to move on from the college I'm familiar with, but I want to make the most of what I've learnt and apply it elsewhere.</p>
